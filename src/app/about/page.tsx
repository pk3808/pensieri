                        Reclaiming the internet for thinkers, writers, and deep readers.

                        Pensieri was born from a simple observation: the modern web is noisy.
                        Algorithm-driven feeds, intrusive ads, and clickbait headlines have made it
                        increasingly difficult to find, read, and write thoughtful content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that writing is thinking. It deserves a space that respects both the
                        creation process and the reading experience.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>
                        To build a digital sanctuary where ideas can breathe. We prioritize typography,
                        white space, and speed over engagement metrics and retention hacks.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why "Pensieri"?</h2>
                    <p>
                        "Pensieri" is Italian for "thoughts". It reflects our commitment to
                        substance over style, and depth over breadth.
